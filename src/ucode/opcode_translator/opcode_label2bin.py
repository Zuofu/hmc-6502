help = """Useage: python opcode_label2bin.py infile [expected_output]
Translation script to replace next-state names in lines of the input file with
their corresponding ROM indices as defined in 6502.ucode.compiled.

If the optional expected_output file is included, this is compared against
the output of the script using diff and the result is sent to out.diff.  If
diff does not produce output the script prints the message "The actual
output matches the expected output." to stderr.
